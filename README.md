# Tomorrow Theme With Markdown

This is a Textmate / Sublime Text colorway based on chriskempson's [Tomorrow Night](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) theme. The only change is the addition of support for Markdown syntax highlighting, based on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/CrazyApi/2354062) by CrazyApi.

Put it in `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Color Scheme - Default/`.

## To Do

- Give this treatment to the rest of the "Tomorrow" textmate theme family
